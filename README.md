<h1>Experiments on E(3) Equivariant GNNs for QM9 dataset</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Dataset: QM9</li>
	<li>Experiments.ipynb has general experiments on prediction of dipole moment from atom embeddings + adjacency list<li>
	<li>e3-eq.ipynb has very simple incorporation of 3d point cloud features + atom embeddings for prediction of electronic spatial extent' output/li>
